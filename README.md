## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IOT-master.git
   cd IOT-master
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install paho-mqtt pymongo
   ```

3. **Make sure MongoDB is running** locally or provide connection details in `gateway/mongo/client.py`.

4. **Run the system:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will launch the sensors, gateway, and processor as a simple simulation pipeline.

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- MQTT Broker (e.g., Mosquitto — optional if testing locally)

---

## 🧪 Test & Extend

- Try modifying `data_simulator.py` to change the format or frequency of sensor data.
- Plug in real MQTT brokers or MongoDB Atlas for live demos.
- Expand `processor.py` to perform analytics, filtering, or alerting logic.
